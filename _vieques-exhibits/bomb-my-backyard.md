During the US Navy's occupation of Vieques (1941-2003), the Navy occupied 22,000 acres of the island and conducted live bombing exercises. This exhibit, named for the "Not in My Backyard" sentiment, allows visitors to Vieques to visualize the extent of the Navy occupation and the proximity of the bombing exercises by placing an overlay centered on an address of their choice.
